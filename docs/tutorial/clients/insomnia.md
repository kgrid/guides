# Insomnia
[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) is a free cross-platform desktop application that takes the pain out of interacting with and designing HTTP-based APIs. Insomnia combines an easy-to-use interface with advanced functionality like authentication helpers, code generation, and environment variables. There is also the option to subscribe to a paid plan to gain access to encrypted data sync and team collaboration.
